the bot sucks

messages the bot

hello

could not

i could probably add a command like !twitch and it would show all the people in the channel who are currently streaming or something

that might be kinda tricky, there are already bots that play music from youtube though

ric suggested i make it play youtube playlists

i was reading a bit about them

dunno

oh it counts how many messages the person has written

type !test

try it, i wanna see what it does when you type it

i copied it off some example, gonna figure out what it does and stuff

so far it only does !test
